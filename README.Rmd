## Overview

The [DynACof](https://vezy.github.io/DynACof) process-based model computes plot-scale Net Primary Productivity, carbon allocation, growth, yield,
energy, and water balance of coffee plantations according to management, while accounting for spatial effects using
metamodels from the 3D process-based [MAESPA](https://maespa.github.io/). The model also uses coffee bud and fruit cohorts for reproductive
development to better represent fruit carbon demand distribution along the year.
Its official website is available [here](https://vezy.github.io/DynACof).

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) can be installed with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("VEZY/DynACof")
```

Or using the lightweight [remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes#readme) package: 

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("VEZY/DynACof")
```

The package is tested routinely to pass all [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) tests using Travis-CI (linux) and AppVeyor (Windows), but is not released to the CRAN servers because we believe DynACof users are not widespread enough to bother CRAN people and use their free server time.

## Example

This is a basic example using all defaults (parameters and meteorology) over 2 years :

```{r example1, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
library("DynACof")
Sys.setenv(TZ="UTC")
DynACof(Period= as.POSIXct(c("1979-01-01", "1980-12-31")))
```

To use your own data, you have to tell DynACof where to find it using `Inpath` parameter, and what are the file names with the `FileName` parameter list. A separate [Github repository](https://github.com/VEZY/DynACof_inputs) is available for input files templates, and some help on how to proceed.

Example using custom input parameter files:
```{r example2, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
library("DynACof")
Sys.setenv(TZ="UTC")
DynACof(WriteIt = T, Period = as.POSIXct(c("1979-01-01", "1980-12-31")),
        Inpath = "1-Input/Aquiares/", Simulation_Name = "Test1",
        FileName = list(Site = "1-Site.R", Meteo ="2-Meteorology.txt",
                        Soil = "3-Soil.R",Coffee = "4-Coffee.R", Tree = NULL))
```
  
Note that the Meteo file can be of any regular format because the 
model uses the `data.table::fread` function internally.

## Code of conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Acknowledgments

The DynACof model was mainly developed thanks to the MACCAC project^[**MACACC project ANR-13-AGRO-0005**,
Viabilité et Adaptation des Ecosystèmes Productifs, Territoires et Ressources face aux Changements Globaux 
AGROBIOSPHERE 2013 program], which was funded by the french ANR (Agence Nationale de la Recherche). The authors were funded by 
CIRAD^[Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement] and INRA^[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique]. The authors are grateful for the support of CATIE^[Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza] for the long-term coffee agroforestry trial, the SOERE F-ORE-T which is supported annually by Ecofor, Allenvi and the French national research infrastructure [ANAEE-F](http://www.anaee-france.fr/fr/); the CIRAD-IRD-SAFSE project (France) and the PCP platform of CATIE. CoffeeFlux observatory was supported and managed by CIRAD researchers. We are grateful to the staff from Costa-Rica, in particular Alvaro Barquero, Alejandra Barquero, Jenny Barquero, Alexis Perez, Guillermo Ramirez, Rafael Acuna, Manuel Jara, Alonso Barquero for their technical and field support.
