# DynACof: The Dynamic Agroforestry Coffee Crop Model <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/VEZY/DynACof.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/VEZY/DynACof)  

## Overview

The DynACof process-based model computes plot-scale Net Primary Productivity, carbon allocation, growth, yield,
energy, and water balance of coffee plantations according to management, while accounting for spatial effects using
metamodels from the 3D process-based MAESPA. The model also uses coffee bud and fruit cohorts for reproductive
development to better represent fruit carbon demand distribution along the year.

## Installation

You can install the released version of DynACof (soon) from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("DynACof")
```

And the development version (only version for now) from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("VEZY/DynACof")
```
## Example

This is a basic example using all defaults (parameters and meteoroloy) over 2 years :

```{r example1, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
library("DynACof")
Sys.setenv(TZ="UTC")
DynACof(Period= as.POSIXct(c("1979-01-01", "1980-12-31")))
```

To use your own data, you'll have to tell DynACof where to find it using `Inpath` parameter, and what is the 
files names with the `FileName` parameter list:  
```{r example2, eval=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
library("DynACof")
Sys.setenv(TZ="UTC")
DynACof(WriteIt = T, Period= as.POSIXct(c("1979-01-01", "1980-12-31")),Inpath = "1-Input/Aquiares/",
                    Simulation_Name = "Test1",
                    FileName = list(Site = "1-Site.R", Meteo ="2-Meteorology.txt", Soil = "3-Soil.R",
                                    Coffee = "4-Coffee.R", Tree = NULL))
```
  
Note that the Meteo file can be of any regular format because the 
model uses the `data.table::fread` function internally.

Enjoy !!
