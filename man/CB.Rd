\title{Temperature-dependent correction function for buds (CB)}
\usage{
CB()
}
\value{
A function to predict the temperature correction coefficient (see Eq. 36 from Vezy et al. (in prep.))
}
\description{
Make a monotone Hermite spline function (Fritsch and Carlson, 1980) fitted on Drinnan et al. (1995)
data. This function is given as a parameter in the coffee parameter file to be further used in the model as
`Bud_T_correction()` so the user can modify the function and give it as input.
}
\details{
As temperature increases, the number of nodes on coffee increases due to increased vegetative
growth (see `CN()`), but the number of buds per nodes decreases.
The number of buds is computed by using a temperature correction factor that decreases with increasing
mean temperature during bud development (0-1, and =1 if mean T < 23).
This factor is then applied on the number of buds that break dormancy (less buds break dormancy with
increasing T).
}
\examples{
# The function returns the temperature correction function itself.
# It is called inside DynACof using the leaf temperature:
Tleaf= 10:30
plot(Tleaf,CB()(Tleaf), pch= 19, ylab="Buds correction factor (CB)", xlab= "Leaf temperature (Â°C)")
