## The Dynamic Agroforestry Coffee Crop Model
The DynACof process-based model computes plot-scale Net Primary Productivity, carbon allocation, growth, yield,
energy, and water balance of coffee plantations according to management, while accounting for spatial effects using
metamodels from the 3D process-based MAESPA. The model also uses coffee bud and fruit cohorts for reproductive
development to better represent fruit carbon demand distribution along the year.
